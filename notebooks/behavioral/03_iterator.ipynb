    "The behavioral patterns are guidelines suggested to create classes that allows to communicate objects to each other. The goal of the behavioral patterns is to make those interactions easier and more understandable.\n",

    "1. Chain of Responsability\n",
    "2. Command\n",
    "3. Iterator\n",
    "4. Mediator\n",
